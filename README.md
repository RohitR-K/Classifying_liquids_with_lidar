# Classifying_liquids_with_lidar
This is a Term Project of Ubiquitous Computing, in which we classified liquids based on their viscosity using iPhone's LiDAR Sensor

This project provides the tools for preprocessing videos to classify liquids using LIDAR. Users can run video conversions and extract blue channel frames, applying this process to their own video data.

## Repo Structure

- `src`: Scripts for video processing. This is also there in FullCode.ipynb
- `FullCode.ipynb`: Contains the primary notebook for step-by-step experimentation.

## Usage

### Prerequisites
Install dependencies with:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
